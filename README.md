Compiling:
In order to compile and run the system you must compile all java files.
If there is a problem in compiling it is most likely the /.idea/libraries/lib.xml root directories not being correctly
linked up for your device, this can be manually changed as appropriate.

Running:
To run run the file named Main.java.
If the game refuses to start up this could be due to a severly corrupted save.txt  file that can be removed. However, it
can also be due to a slow running computer.

Using:
The game runs via different text commands. Below are the listed commands:
- Drop
- Inventory
- Take
- Go
- Look
- Quit
- Talk
Saving is done via the quit command. If you wish to start a new save after already starting one this must be done via
manual deletion of the save.txt file. However, the game is only ~1 minute long so it should not even need to be
manually quit.

THE JAR FILE IS IN THE BUILD AREA AS IT CANNOT BE ATTACHED VIA BRIGHTSPACE
